Within the site you a have a few options. 
- First you can Randomize the color using the `Randomize Color` button.
- Also you can copy all the color values, for `RGBA` and `HEX` values, using the `Copy Color Ramp` button.
- When clicking, `Select a Color:` Or picking the color from the top right square of the tools, you will be able to set a color of the highest point on the color ramp you're creating. *Try experimenting with two strongly saturated colors.*
- If you only want a specific color, you're able to click within the square, which will give you the `HEX` and `RGBA` values.
